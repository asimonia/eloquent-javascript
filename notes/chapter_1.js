// Values, types, operators
// Key Concepts & Questions

/*  
(1) What are the 6 types in javascript?  What is a type and value?
(2) How is js weakly typed?
(3) Talk about logical, comparison, arithmetic, and ternary operators operators.

// Values are made up of bits and bytes
// Types are types of values. There are six.
// number, string, boolean, object, function, undefined
// Javascript is weakly typed, so you can do weird things like "5" + 1 returns 4


// Operators are symbols that perform some function on the operands
// Comparisons, arithmetic
// && (and)		|| (or)		!= (not)	(short-circuit evaluation)
// && returns true only if both operands are true
// || returns true if either or operands are true
// ===  (equal to value and type)  (use three character comparisions)
// NaN is not a number

// Ternary operator (conditional)
// True ? 1 : 2			// returns 1
// False ? 10 : 100		// returns 100
